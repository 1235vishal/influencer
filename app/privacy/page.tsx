          This section is applicable only to residents of the European Economic
          Area, Switzerland and the U.K. (“European Residents”), and discusses
          how we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679)
          of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the
          protection of natural persons regarding the processing of Personal
          Information and on the free movement of such data (“GDPR”).
          <br />
          <br />
          Under the GDPR, we are the controller and co-processor of the Personal
          Information of European Residents. Our purpose for collecting and
          processing Personal Information from European Residents is to provide
          them with information regarding our Services.  We do not, however,
          ship our products outside the United States from our Site.  The legal
          basis for collecting Personal Information is your consent to obtain
          information about our Services.  You may withdraw consent from
          receiving marketing and promotional communications by clicking the
          “Unsubscribe” link on the communication or contacting us at
          <br />
          <br />
           hello@influencermarketinghub.com.  If European Residents do not
          provide Personal Information to us or withdraw consent for processing
          such Personal Information, we may not be able to provide such
          residents with information regarding our Services.  You may still be
          able to obtain information regarding our products or purchase products
          through one of the sites run by our authorized distributors.

          <br />
          European Residents may obtain information about the Personal
          Information that we hold about them by contacting us using the

            International data transfers
          </h2>
          Some of our data processors listed above are located outside the
          country in which you reside. For example, if you reside in the
          European Economic Area (EEA), we may need to transfer your personal
          data to jurisdictions outside the EEA. Whenever we make such a
          transfer, we will make sure that either (a) the jurisdiction in which
          the recipient third party is located guarantees an adequate level of
          protection for your personal data or (b) we conclude a agreement with
          the applicable third party that ensures such data-privacy protection
          (such as by including GDPR-compliant standard contractual clauses
          (SCCs)).. We will not transfer your personal data internationally if
          no appropriate level of protection can be granted.
          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-3">
            California-specific disclosures
          </h2>
          The section is applicable only to individuals or households in
          California (“California consumers”).  
          <br />
          <br />
          The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California
          consumers with additional rights regarding Personal Information that
          identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated
          with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly with a
          particular consumer or household. The categories of Personal
          Information we collect are generally described above but differ for
          individual consumers depending on the Services used by such consumers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Under the CCPA, California consumers have the following rights:
          <br />
          <br />
          Right to Know and Right to Delete.
          <br />
          <br />
          A California consumer has the right to request that we disclose what
          Personal Information we collect, use, disclose and sell. A California
          consumer also has the right to submit requests to delete Personal
          Information.
          <br />
          <br />
          When we receive a request to know or delete from a California
          consumer, we will confirm receipt of the request within 10 business
          days and provide information about how we will process the request,
          including our verification process. We will respond to such requests
          within 45 days.
          <br />
          <br />
          Right for Disclosure of Personal Information.
          <br />
          <br />
          A California consumer may also submit requests that we disclose
          specific types or categories of Personal Information that we collect.
          <br />
          <br />
          Under certain circumstances, we will not provide such information,
          including where the disclosure creates a substantial, articulable and
          unreasonable risk to the security of that Personal Information,
          customers’ accounts with us, or the security of our systems or
          networks. We also will not disclose California consumers’ social
          security numbers, driver’s license numbers or other government-issued
          identification numbers, financial account numbers, any health
          insurance or medical identification numbers, or account passwords and
          security questions and answers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Submitting Requests
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are a California consumer and would like to make any requests
          under the CCPA, please direct them to us using the information below
          under “Contact Information”.
          <br />
          <br />
          Verifying Requests
          <br />
          <br />
          If we receive any request we will use a two-step process for online
          requests where the California consumer must first, clearly submit the
          request and then second, separately confirm the request. We will use
          other appropriate measures to verify requests received by mail or
          telephone.
          <br />
          <br />
          In submitting a request, a California consumer must provide sufficient
          information to identify the consumer, such as name, email address,
          home or work address, or other such information that is on record with
          us so that we can match such information to the Personal Information
          that we maintain. Do not provide social security numbers, driver’s
          license numbers, account numbers, credit or debit card numbers,
          medical information or health information with requests. If requests
          are unclear or submitted through means other than as outlined above,
          we will provide the California consumer with specific directions on
          how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies. If we cannot
          verify the identity of the requestor, we may deny the request.
          <br />
          <br />
          California Do Not Track Disclosures
          <br />
          <br />
          Although some browsers currently offer a “do not track (‘DNT’)
          option,” no common industry standard for DNT exists. We therefore do
          not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals.
          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-3">Miscellaneous</h2>
          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-3">Children</h2>
          Our Services are directed at a general audience and not directed to
          those under the age of 18. IMH asks that minors not submit any
          personal data. IMH does not knowingly collect personal data from
          individuals under 16 years of age and if we obtain actual knowledge
          that a user is under 16 years of age, we will take steps to remove
          that individual”s personal data from our systems.
          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-3">Retention of Personal Data</h2>
          We retain personal data we collect from you for as long as you use our
          Services or, if longer, as necessary to fulfill the legitimate
          business need for which it was collected.   For example, we retain
          information in order to provide you with the Services, to comply with
          applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements, and to enforce our
          agreements, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve
          disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our terms of use,
          or take other actions permitted by law. We may also retain information
          to prevent re-registration in the event that your account has been
          suspended or terminated or to create an archival copy of your
          information, which might be used by us for record keeping and internal
          purposes.
          <br />
          <br />
          We do not discriminate against you if you decide to exercise your
          rights. It means that we will not (i) deny any goods and services,
          (ii) charge you different prices, (iii) deny any discounts or
          benefits, (iv) impose penalties, or (v) provide you with lower quality
          services.
