          To access the full functionality of the Website, you are requested to
          register an account (the “User Account”). By registering the User
          Account, You agree to: (i) provide and keep current, accurate and
          complete information about Yourself and Your company (“Information”);
          (ii) maintain the confidentiality of your User Account and log-in
          credentials, if applicable; and (iii) restrict access to the User
          Account to all others. You agree to accept responsibility for all
          activities that occur under the User Account. If We have reasonable
          grounds to suspect that the Information You provide is inaccurate,
          incomplete or impersonates another person, We reserve the right to

          Password or Sign-In Name, or change any Unique Identifier. We reserve
          the right to delete or change Your Password, Sign-In Name, or Unique
          Identifier at any time and for any reason and shall have no liability
          to You for any loss or damage caused by such action. IMH will not be
          liable for any loss or damage caused by any unauthorized use of Your

            2. Fees, Payment and Refund Policy
          </p>
          <b>The Fees.</b>As consideration for any purchase You make on the
          Website, You shall pay IMH all applicable fees and taxes
          (collectively, the “Fees”). We (or our third-party payment processor)
          shall authorize your credit card, bank account, or other approved
          payment facility that You provided during the registration process for
          the full payment of the Fees, and you hereby consent to the same. All
          Fees will be charged and made in U.S. dollars. The Fees remain valid
          for as long as they are indicated on the Website or (ii) as
          communicated by Us. The Fees are subject to change without a prior
          notice. Any changes to the Fees will be made available on the Website.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Payments.</b> All payments are processed by Our third-party payment
          processors (the “Payment Processors”). When You make a payment, the
          Payment Processors collect some personal data from You which allows
          them to make the payments requested by You (e.g., your credit card
          number, expiration date, billing address, and security codes). The
          Payment Processors handle all steps in the payment process through
          their systems, including data collection and data processing. IMH does
          not have direct access to Your full payment information - only a few
          details (e.g., your billing address) are made available to Us. You are
          responsible for ensuring that all payment information is correct and
          the funds necessary for payment are available. You agree not to hold
          Us liable for payments that do not reach Us because You have quoted
          incorrect payment information or the Payment Processors refused the
          payment for any other reason
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Refund Policy.</b> At IMH, We are confident that You will get
          results, so We give you an entire calendar month (30 days) to complete
          Our courses available on the Website (the “Courses”), do the work and
          put what you’ve learned to the test. Which is why when You enroll in
          any of Our Courses as a student, You get a “30-Day Guarantee.” The
          guarantee states that, if You enroll on one of our Courses, watch all
          the video lessons, complete all of the required work and action items,
          and still don’t see results within the first month (30 days), IMH will
          provide a full refund. 
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Terms governing Our 30-Day Guarantee.</b> In order to qualify for a
          refund, You must have completed the Courses, and emailed Us within 30
          days from your enrolment date, providing proof that You did the work
          in the Courses and it did not work for You. You must include
          screenshots of all modules completed, quiz completions, as well as the
          required
          <br />
          <b>assignments.</b> (specific to each course). If You request a refund
          and do not include Your completed coursework by the 30th day, You will
          not be granted a refund. If You haven’t completed the Courses or the
          required assignments, then You won’t be eligible for the 30 day
          guarantee. We’ll ask for your completed course work and ask what
          didn’t work for You. In order to make an application for a refund in
          accordance with Our 30- Day Guarantee guidelines, You will need to
          provide the supporting evidence:
          <ul className="my-3 list-disc">
            <li className="ms-6">Requirement 1: Proof of Course completion</li>
            <li className="ms-6">
              Requirement 2: Complete & attach the Course workbook that should
              include Your notes/answers, to demonstrate that You’ve taken the
              time to apply the Course lessons
            </li>
            <li className="ms-6">
              Requirement 3: Provide Us with a written motivation detailing why
              this  Course was not a good fit for You and your business needs.
              What did you expect that You did not receive once You gained
              access to the Course?

              strategies and tactics

          </ul>
          <b>Right of withdrawal.</b> We respect consumer rights and comply with
          the applicable consumer protection laws. If You use the the Website or
          purchase the Courses as a consumer (i.e., you act wholly or mainly
          outside the scope of your trade, business, or profession), in some
          limited cases, You have the right to withdraw from the service
          contract with us within the period of 14 days after the service
          contract was concluded, unless the provision of the services was
          completed by us (i.e., you gained access to the Courses). In most
          cases, You will not be able to exercise your right of withdrawal
          because, by concluding a service contract with Us, You gain access to
          the Courses. Please contact Us for more information. If You act as a
          business, trader, or use the Website for professional purposes, you
          are not entitled to exercise your right of withdrawal.
