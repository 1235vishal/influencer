          We&apos;ve always believed in transparency on the web. At Influencer
          Marketing Hub we occasionally include certain products and links to
          those products on this site, which means we earn an affiliate
          commission for any purchases you make. Our goal is to help educate you
          on the possibilities that exist in the field of marketing.
          <br />
          <br />
          The site has grown so big at this point that it is nearly impossible
          to go back through and list each and every program that we have an
          affiliate agreement with. Given this, you should assume that any links
          leading you to products or services are affiliate links that we will
          receive compensation from just to be safe. Having said that, there are
          millions of products and services on the web that relate to blogging
          and making money online. We only promote those products or services
          that we have investigated and truly feel deliver value to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please note that we have not been given any free products, services or
          anything else by these companies in exchange for mentioning them on
          the site. The only consideration is in the form of affiliate
          commissions.
          <br />

          If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate
          to contact us by using the contact page.
