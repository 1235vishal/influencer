        <h5 className="text-lg font-bold">How We Make Money</h5>
        <p>
          At Influencer Marketing Hub, we forge partnerships that may influence
          the lineup of products or services we review, as well as their
          placement on our website. However, this does not sway the counsel or
          endorsements we bestow. Our assessments emerge from extensive
          experience and relentless research, untainted by compensation. Our
          partners are aware that their support cannot buy our favorable
          judgment of their offerings.
          <br />
          <br />
          The integrity behind our content is paramount. When we feature a
          product, service, or application within our analyses or editorials, we
          may embed affiliate links. These links present an opportunity for us
          to earn a referral fee if you decide to utilize the service,
          contributing to our mission of delivering insightful content. This
          financial model underpins our platform and enables continual growth.
          <br />
          <br />
          Yet, our allegiance lies unwaveringly with you, our audience. Every
          review is rooted in rigorous testing and is a reflection of our
          genuine opinion. Our enthusiasm for a product is only shared if we
          find merit in it ourselves. And should our experience fall short of
          our expectations, we maintain the candor to voice our true
          perspective, independent of any commercial ties. For an in-depth
          understanding of our principles, please refer to our full disclosure
