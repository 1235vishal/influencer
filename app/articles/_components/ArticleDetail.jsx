        Last year&apos;s data from our annual Influencer Marketing Benchmark
        Report, which asked respondents &quot;Which channels do you
        predominantly tap into for influencer marketing campaigns?&quot;
        indicated a much higher preference for TikTok, with 67.8% of brands
        leveraging it for their campaigns. This contrasts with this year&apos;s
        survey phrasing, &quot;Which platforms do you primarily use for
        influencer marketing campaigns?&quot; where only 38% of respondents
        indicated TikTok as their choice.
